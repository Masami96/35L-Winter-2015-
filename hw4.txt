2. git checkout v3.0 -b quote
   the six modified folders from earlier are displayed with an M in front
3. while in the diffutils directory
   patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt
   the 6 files from earlier were patched
4.
5. emacs quote-patch.txt (the original patch file)
   use C-x 4 a to add the ChangeLog
   I wrote a short description of the patch and the 6 modified files
6. git add .
   git commit -a -F ChangeLog
7. git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt
   the option -1 is used to format only the commit
   --stdout is used so the commit is printed in "mbox" format
8. after acquiring the patch
   git checkout v3.0 -b partner
   git am formatted-patch.txt
   this returns as patch failed
   make check
   ends with 'check-recursvie' failed and then Error 1
9. make distdir outputs a ton of "checking ..."
   emacs diffutils*/ChangeLog
   the ChangeLog did correctly add my ChangeLog to the log (mine is newest)
   however, I am still unsure of what actual content should have been
   inserted into the ChangeLog (if the original commit was supposed to have
   been copy pasted or something)
10.since the directory doesn't appear to exist anymore (can't cd into it)
   go to the savannah site and first clone it with
   git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/emacs.git
   it takes quite a while for this process to complete
