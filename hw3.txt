Q1. case_long_iso_time_style: was removed since
    case long_iso_time_style: was already present
    removing this line is not necessary, it only cleans up the code
    the switch statement already catches the case long... so that line
    was just not being used ever

Q2. Countries that do not use the MM/DD/YYYY format may be confused and be
    unable to interpret the information
    If an application relies on the numerical format of ls -l output, then
    that application may no longer work as expected

Q3. It outputs the following

    Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "./randline.py", line 70, in <module>
    	 main()
    File "./randlin.py", line 64, in main
    	 sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
    File "./randline.py", line 34, in chooseline
    	 return random.choice(self.lines)
    File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/random/py", line 274, in choice
    	 return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]
# raises IndexError if seq is empty
IndexError: list index out of range

There is no length to the list at all, which is why the index is out of range

Q4. using the command: python3 ./randline.py outputs:

    File "./randline.py", line 65
    	 except IOError as (errno, strerror):
	 		   ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

This error occurs because python3 uses different syntax than python 2
