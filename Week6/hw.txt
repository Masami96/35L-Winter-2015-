1. Yes, our network is still secure because the data is encrypted. The bytes
they read would be meaningless.
(1) If they keylogged us (recorded keystrokes) the data would still be safe.
They would only receive our public key, unless we actually typed in the data
itself (then obviously they would get the data).
(2) With the physical USB they would receive everything, including our private
key. Thus, they could decrypt all of the information between any client and the
server. While this is fairly safe to do (boot from the USB), it makes the USB
far more valuable, meaning we should not allow people outside the team even
have access to where our USB is kept.

2. gpg --verify checks for the integrity of the sent document. Unlike a
certificate, an attacker could use a public key to sign in as someone else.
We would need a certificate (or something like it). A third party program can
keep track of who uses what public key.
