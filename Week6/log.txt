First, boot up Ubuntu from my usb drive (I have yet to install it) and launch
the terminal. Also works for the cd given by the TA.

Install both the server and client (I had client already installed) so run
sudo apt-get install openssh-server

Took turns being client/server

Server:
generate the keys (both pub and priv)
ssh-keygen
(put in the default /home/ubuntu/.ssh and ignore the passphrase)
generate an account for the client on my server
sudo useradd -d /home/<homedirectoryname> -m <username>
sudo passwd <username>
(I filled in the blanks with generic usernames and a simple pw)
create a ssh directory in the home directory
sudo mkdir .ssh
modify the permissions for the new ssh directory
sudo chown -R <username> .ssh
sudo schmod 700 .ssh
(only the user can read, write, and exec)
get rid of the need for a password:
emacs /etc/ssh/sshd_config
(change Password Authetntication to "No")
The client can now connect! IP addresses match once ssh'd in using
ifconfig

Client:
generate the keys (pub and priv)
ssh-keygen
ignore the passphrase
copy the public key to server from ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
(partner had to make me a username and I got his ip by having him use ifconfig)
ssh-copy-id -i (GivenUserName)@(Server'sIPAddress)
asked if wanted to connect (they had password disabled)
add private key to authentication agent
ssh-add
now ssh into the server using either of the below
(depending on what you want to accomplish):
ssh UserName@ServerIP
ssh -X UserName@ServerIP
test the connection using
xterm
firefox
ifconfig (this provides my partner's IP)
