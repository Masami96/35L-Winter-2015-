First I made a file test.txt of 51200 bytes
time cat test.txt | ./sfrobu "qwertyuiop" "poiuytrewq"
real 0m0.003s
user 0m0.000s
sys  0m0.003s

time cat test.txt | ./sfrob "qwertyuiop" "poiuytrewq"
real 0m0.002s
user 0m0.001s
sys  0m0.002s

time cat test.txt | ./sfrobs
real 0m0.008s
user 0m0.003s
sys  0m0.006s

According to this, the sfrobs is going to be much slower overall than both the
sfrobu and sfrob funcitons.
Now remake test.txt to a file of much smaller size
The 3 all run fairly close to one another (very little deviation) which is
expected due to the small size of the file being passed in

The number of comparisons should be O(nlogn)?
