Arvind - This browser upgrade could block users in developing nations from most of the web
tldr; hardware cannot keep up with software
-Hashing algorithm SHA-1 is being removed and replaced with SHA-2
-(Hashing algorithm) Takes msg as input, and cryptographs, and stores the input as a hash
-usually cotains an "avalanche effect" where one difference in the input can totally change the resulting hash
-98.7% of websites use SHA1 still. Internet moves on very slowly
-new algorithms need to be created to stay up to date with the improving power of computers
-developing countries sometimes have a decent chunk of the population that cant support SHA2
-as newer algorithms are adopted, older technology is no longer supported
-hashing algorithms and cracking algorithms (cat and mouse game)

Yi Zhang - Facial recognition software
-like on facebook, facial recognition software is fairly accurate, but limited (need proper lighting, angles, etc.)
-applications include:
	medical use (detect anxiety, depression, autism, etc.)
	evaluate public speaking
	dating apps
	security (detect terrorism and criminals)
-concerns include:
	privacy 
	surveillance of society
thermal cameras would get rid of issues like having hats sunglasses etc. but would require a large data base

Yulin Zhang - Driverless cars are colliding with the creepy trolley problem
-Tesla and Google have been making advancements in driverless cars
-ethics of driverless cars
	-do you let the car decide to kill 1 person rather than 5?
	-should you sacrifice the driver in order to save a greater number of people?
	
Low Level Virtual Machine (name of project for compiler)

GOTPass (Secure alternative to Regular Passwords)
-various ways to crack pw's 
-creating a GOTPass
	-create username
	-"Draw"a pic from a 4x4 grid
	-select an image from a group of 4
-more secure, but takes over 2min to create and around 24.5sec to login

Brain Mapping

MarioAI (social interactions for AI)
-creates a matrix of pixels and trasnforms that to a button
-has the different mario characters interact and let each other know the results of their actions
