1. mkdir gitroot
   cd gitroot
   git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/diffutils.git

   It takes a bit to download, but is pulled fine
2. cd diffutils
   git log > git-log.txt

   the new text file shows the commits the author and the date
3. git tag > git-tags.txt

   contains a list of versions
4. Found the commit:
   commit 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f
   git show 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f > quote-patch.txt
5. while in the diffutils directory
   git checkout v3.0
6. While still in the diffutils directory
   patch -p1 < quote-patch.txt
   there were three errors, and 3 files were skipped
   y [Enter] three times
7. git status
   modified files include
   NEWS README TODO doc/diagmeet.note ms/config.bat ms/config.site po/en.po
   src/analyze.c src/cmp.c src/context.c src/diff.h src/diff3.c src/dir.c
   src/ifdef.c src/io.c src/sdiff.c src/side.c src/system.h src/util.c
   tests/help-version
   there are a number of untracked files
8. Go to all the non .c files and revert them using
   vc-revert (C-x v-u)
   all the modified files only include .c files now
9. go to the c files and perform
   vc-diff (C-x v-=)
   revert all the comment hunks using
   C-u C-c C-a
   apply changes to hunks with no comments using
   C-c C-a
   move to the next hunk using M-n
   manually go through the .c files, and revert all of the changes that affect
   only the comments. keep all changes to actual code
   git status returns the following files to still be modified
   src/cmp.c src/diff.c src/diff3.c src/dir.c src/sdiff.c src/util.c
10.emacs into src/diff.c.rej and apply those unapplied patches manually
   into src/diff.c
   do the same with src/diff3.c.rej and src/diff3.c
11.using the rm [filename] command, I removed all untracked files leaving only
   6 files
12.git diff > quote-3.0-patch.txt
13.after running ./bootstrap bash runs some process for about 3-5 minutes
   running ./configure performs a lot of "checking for" and "checking whether"
   make runs through a bunch of files
   make check runs but has some recipes fail
   cd src and then run
   ./diff . -
   ./diff --help
   and both output lines that replace the ` with ' appropriately
14.I copied my diffutils twice using
   cp -rf diffutils [newDirectory]
   then I ran (while in gitroot directory)
   diffutils/src/diff -pru diffutils-3.0 diffutils-3.0-patch
   > quote-3.0-test.txt 
15.The changes are indeed innocuous (the ` characters were changed to ')
   Changes were also only made in the code, no comments
